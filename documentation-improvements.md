# Documentation Improvements for CE Library Wizard

This document outlines features and capabilities that are implemented but not properly documented or showcased in the README.

## Major Undocumented Features

### 1. Advanced C++ Features
- **`--install-test` flag** - Actually tests library installation (not just path checking)
- **Library type detection** - Automatically detects header-only vs compiled libraries by scanning for CMakeLists.txt
- **Intelligent library ID suggestion** - Converts GitHub URLs to proper `lowercase_with_underscores` format
- **Path validation** - Validates library paths before committing
- **Windows support** - Full Windows PowerShell integration (not well documented)

### 2. Sophisticated Git Workflow
- **Automatic fork detection** - Uses existing forks if available, creates new ones if needed
- **Feature branch naming** - Creates descriptive branch names like `add-cpp-fmt-10-2-1-infra`
- **Smart commit detection** - Only commits and pushes if there are actual changes
- **Cross-repository PR linking** - Automatically links related PRs between infra and main repos

### 3. Error Handling & Recovery
- **Graceful failure modes** - Continues with warnings instead of hard failures
- **Environment cleanup** - Automatic cleanup of temporary directories
- **Duplicate detection** - Warns if library version already exists instead of failing

### 4. Advanced Authentication
- **Multi-method fallback** - GitHub CLI → OAuth → Token with intelligent fallback
- **Local OAuth server** - Built-in OAuth server on port 8745 (security feature)
- **CSRF protection** - State parameter in OAuth flow (not mentioned)

### 5. Developer Experience Features
- **Rich diff preview** - Shows exactly what will be changed with `--verify`
- **Interactive confirmation** - Asks for confirmation after showing diffs
- **Comprehensive logging** - Debug mode with detailed operation logging
- **Cross-platform support** - Different command execution for Windows vs Unix

### 6. Undocumented CLI Options
The CLI has more sophisticated argument handling than documented, including validation and smart defaults.

## Missing Documentation Sections

### 1. Troubleshooting Guide
- Common error scenarios and solutions
- What to do when authentication fails
- How to handle merge conflicts
- Repository permission issues

### 2. Development Workflow
- How to test changes locally
- Running the tool against test repositories
- Validating library additions before submission

### 3. Configuration Options
- Environment variables and their effects
- OAuth server port configuration
- Debug output customization

### 4. Advanced Usage Patterns
- Batch operations for multiple libraries
- CI/CD integration examples
- Automated library updates

### 5. Architecture Details
- How the dual-repository workflow actually works
- Why both infra and main repos are needed
- Branch naming conventions and merge strategy

### 6. Security Model
- OAuth flow details and security considerations
- Token handling and storage (or lack thereof)
- Fork-based security model explanation
- CSRF protection mechanisms

## Specific CLI Features to Document

### Enhanced `--verify` Flag
- Shows comprehensive diffs for both repositories
- Interactive confirmation workflow
- Ability to cancel after reviewing changes

### `--install-test` Flag for C++
- Only works on non-Windows systems
- Actually attempts library installation
- Validates that library can be built and linked

### Debug Mode Enhancements
- Detailed logging of all operations
- Environment variable inspection
- Command execution tracing

### Smart Defaults and Validation
- Library ID suggestion algorithm
- GitHub URL validation
- Version format checking

## Examples That Should Be Added

### Advanced C++ Usage
```bash
# Test library installation before committing
./run.sh --lang=cpp --lib=https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt --ver=10.2.1 --install-test

# Preview changes with detailed diff
./run.sh --verify --lang=cpp --lib=https://github.com/nlohmann/json --ver=3.11.3
```

### Debug and Development
```bash
# Debug mode with comprehensive logging
./run.sh --debug --lang=rust --lib=serde --ver=1.0.195

# OAuth with verification workflow
./run.sh --oauth --verify --lang=cpp --lib=https://github.com/gabime/spdlog --ver=1.12.0
```

### Error Recovery Scenarios
```bash
# What happens when library already exists
# What happens when authentication fails
# What happens when repositories can't be cloned
```

## Documentation Structure Suggestions

### 1. Expand "How it Works" Section
- Add more detail about the dual-repository workflow
- Explain branch creation and naming
- Document the PR creation and linking process

### 2. Add "Advanced Features" Section
- Document all the sophisticated features not covered in basic usage
- Explain when and why to use each feature

### 3. Add "Troubleshooting" Section
- Common error scenarios
- Authentication troubleshooting
- Repository access issues

### 4. Add "Development" Section
- How to contribute to the tool
- Testing procedures
- Local development setup

### 5. Enhance "Security Notes"
- Expand OAuth flow explanation
- Document CSRF protection
- Explain fork-based security model

## CLI Help Text Improvements
The current CLI help could be enhanced to better explain:
- What each authentication method does
- When to use `--verify` vs `--install-test`
- What the debug mode actually shows
- Platform-specific behaviors

## Implementation Notes
- Most of these features are already implemented in the codebase
- They just need proper documentation and examples
- Some features like `--install-test` have platform restrictions that should be clearly documented
- The sophisticated error handling and recovery mechanisms are not explained to users
