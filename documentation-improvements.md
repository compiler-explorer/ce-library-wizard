# Documentation Improvements for CE Library Wizard

This document tracks remaining documentation needs that haven't been addressed yet.

## Still Undocumented

### 1. Windows Support
- **Windows support** - Full Windows PowerShell integration exists but is not documented
- We removed Windows from documentation since it's not fully supported, but the code has some Windows handling

### 2. OAuth Configuration (Partially Documented)
- **CE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID** and **CE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET** - For custom OAuth apps (mentioned in error messages but not in main docs)

### 3. CLI Help Text Improvements
The current CLI help could be enhanced to better explain:
- What each authentication method does
- When to use `--verify` vs `--install-test` vs `--keep-temp`
- What the debug mode actually shows
- Platform-specific behaviors
